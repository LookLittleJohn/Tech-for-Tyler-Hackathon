## Crowder

Leveraging the power of the Internet of Things, Crowder can gather real time events to inform drivers about full parking lots, reducing the amount of traffic in crowded areas

Crowder is meant to be a proof of concept application to show how we can manage traffic in various environments.  It can be used to monitor parking lots and let the consumer know how full a parking lot is at any given time.  You can also use it to monitor how full a restaurant is or how many bikes are at a given bike rack. Consumer will need to put sensors at the entrances to monitor how full the given space is.
